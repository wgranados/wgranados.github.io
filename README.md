Hey, I'm William Granados!

I'm a third year student in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Toronto, My interests include: programming, pokemon, and video games.

Iâ€™m one of the co-founders for the Computer Science Enrichment Club (**CSEC**), and currently interim president. The club was inspired by a previous club I attended in high school (**PEG**).
