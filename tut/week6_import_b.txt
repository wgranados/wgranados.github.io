# step 1: basic import
# import week6_import_a
# print(week6_import_a.my_cool_function())

# step 2: giving it a better name
import week6_import_a as imp
# part of step 2, you can import specific functions/variables
# into your current global scope
from week6_import_a import tutorial_room

# part of step 2, printing out information we obtained from our import
print(imp.my_cool_function())
print(tutorial_room)

# part of step 4
print("The name of week5_import_b is: ", __name__)

# step 5: show how main code can be hidden
if(__name__ == "__main__"):
    print("week5_import_b.py is being run as the main file")
