            <p>LetMeKnow was initially a successful project I and a couple of colleagues developed over at 
                <a href="https://devpost.com/software/let-me-know-vwao64">MHacks8</a> (top 10, and contenders for Microsoft Prize). 
                Since October of 2016 myself the other team members have been making incremental changes in our spare time to the software. 
                In November 2017 we entered LMK into the <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/projects/thehub/startup-competition/">UTSC Startup Competition</a> 
                and received seed funding and access to great mentors/resources.

                Some of the core technologies I have worked with our NGINX, Django, and Angular.  
                Some of the major features I was a core developer of were: the fetching of relevant articles/images/tweets, summarization of articles, 
                and some UI portability changes on the landing page. We're currently undergoing rapid development, so expect to see some cooler stuff soon!
