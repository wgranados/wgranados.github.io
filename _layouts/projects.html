           This application is cable of correctly categorizing objects according to the standard set out by the City of Toronto's

        <p>We were tasked with creating a flight booking system for a client. I had to integrate a lot of features for end users and adminstrators. 
           The project was over a span of 2 months, with weekly scrum meetings, and test driven development.
            
            . This took us over a month to complete as we 
           had followed test driven development and had to attend regular weekly scrum meetings to get it right. We also spent a good amount of time tricking out the UI.

        <a href="https://github.com/wgma00/mobile-waste-wizard" style="line-height: 25px;">LetMeKnow</a>
        <p>LetMeKnow was initially a successful project I and a couple of colleagues developed over at 
            <a href="https://devpost.com/software/let-me-know-vwao64">MHacks8</a> (top 10, and contenders for Microsoft Prize). 
            Since October of 2016 myself the other team members have been making incremental changes in our spare time to the software. 
            In November 2017 we entered LMK into the <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/projects/thehub/startup-competition/">UTSC Startup Competition</a> 
            and received seed funding and access to great mentors/resources. I'm the currently system adminstrator and developer for the website. </p>
        <!--p>I'm the current system adminstrator for the website. 
            Some of the core technologies I have worked with our NGINX, Django, and Angular.  
            Some of the major features I was a core developer of were: the fetching of relevant articles/images/tweets, summarization of articles, 
            and some UI portability changes on the landing page. We're currently undergoing rapid development, so expect to see some cooler stuff soon!

        <a href="https://github.com/wgma00/quadbot" style="line-height: 25px;">Quadbot</a>
        <p> Quadbot is free software that acts as a chat bot on the popular platform pokemonshowdown.com. 
            It was intially created due to a lack of support for LaTeX on the Pokemon Showdown! servers; yes <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> 
            also accomplishes the task, but would likely be abused by users to derail conversations, and didn't give power to the users (i.e. me :]). 
            Since then I have added other functionality that I haven't seen on other bots like arbitrary precision arithmetic (that doesn't break), 
            Random Putnam problem generators, <a href="http://cultofthepartyparrot.com/">Party Parrot</a> generator, a neat periodic parser game 
            (try to construct a word using elements from the periodic table), Markov chain generated text, and a whole lot more. 
            I'm actively making changes to this software, and coordinating with the original container for the bot for bug fixes.
